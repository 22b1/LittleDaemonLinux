## Reason for it
I created the "Little Daemon" app to empower users with essential cybersecurity and information-gathering tools. In an increasingly digital world, having quick access to IP data, WHOIS lookups, DNS queries, subdomain enumeration, and username checks is invaluable for security and research. This app aims to provide a user-friendly, all-in-one solution for users to better understand and protect their digital footprint. It was also a unique and wonderful experience in which I learned a lot, and I would like to come back with many revisions to this project.

## Description
The code provided is a C# console application named "Little Daemon" that offers a set of cybersecurity and information gathering tools. Users can interact with the application by selecting various options, such as retrieving information about an IP address, performing WHOIS lookups on domains, conducting DNS lookups, enumerating subdomains, checking for the existence of a username on popular websites, and scanning open ports on a host.

## Key Features:

Interactive menu for user selection of different tools.
Utilizes external services like Google DNS and SecurityTrails for subdomain enumeration.
Retrieves information about IP addresses using the ip-api service.
Performs WHOIS lookups on domain names.
Scans for open ports on a specified host.
Checks for the existence of a username on various social media and web platforms.
The code is accompanied by a license (MIT License) and detailed explanations for each tool's functionality. It provides a command-line interface for users to access various cybersecurity-related utilities, making it a versatile tool for informational and diagnostic purposes.
